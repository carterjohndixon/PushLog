# I want to fix these moderate errors when running my code for nginx:

# [ec2-user@ip-172-31-19-85 pushlog]$ npm audit fix --force
# npm warn using --force Recommended protections disabled.
# npm warn audit Updating drizzle-kit to 0.18.1, which is a SemVer major change.
# npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
# npm warn deprecated glob@8.1.0: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
